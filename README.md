SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) is a method used for autonomous vehicles that lets you build a map and localize your vehicle in that map at the same time. This project aims to build SLAM using an e-puck2 Robot

  

##  Communication

Asercom protocol v2 is used for communication. The factory firmware of the e-puck2 runs this algorithm when selector switch is set to 3.

  

## Steps:

1. Load the e-puck2 with the factory firmware if not already present. The code is available in e-puck2_main-processor folder or [e-puck2 git repo](https://github.com/e-puck2/e-puck2_main-processor)
2. Setup the catkin workspace by installing the dependencies required. [e-puck2 with ROS by GCtronic](https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=e-puck2_PC_side_development#ROS) outlines the process.
3. Clone this repo to src folder of the workspace
